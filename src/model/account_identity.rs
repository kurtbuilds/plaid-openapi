For business accounts, the name reported may be either the name of the individual or the name of the business, depending on the institution; detecting whether the linked account is a business account is not currently supported. Multiple owners on a single account will be represented in the same `owner` object, not in multiple owner objects within the array. In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, the `owners` object is not returned, and instead identity information is returned in the top level `identity` object.
