`match` indicates that the provided input data was a strong match against external data.

`partial_match` indicates the data approximately matched against external data. For example, "Knope" vs. "Knope-Wyatt" for last name.

`no_match` indicates that Plaid was able to perform a check against an external data source and it did not match the provided input data.

`no_data` indicates that Plaid was unable to find external data to compare against the provided input data.

`no_input` indicates that Plaid was unable to perform a check because no information was provided for this field by the end user.*/
