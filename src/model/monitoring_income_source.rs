    /**The income category.
`BANK_INTEREST`: Interest earned from a bank account.
`BENEFIT_OTHER`: Government benefits other than retirement, unemployment, child support, or disability. Currently used only in the UK, to represent benefits such as Cost of Living Payments.
`CASH`: Deprecated and used only for existing legacy implementations. Has been replaced by `CASH_DEPOSIT` and `TRANSFER_FROM_APPLICATION`.
`CASH_DEPOSIT`: A cash or check deposit.
`CHILD_SUPPORT`: Child support payments received.
`GIG_ECONOMY`: Income earned as a gig economy worker, e.g. driving for Uber, Lyft, Postmates, DoorDash, etc.

`SALARY`: Payment from an employer to an earner or other form of permanent employment.
