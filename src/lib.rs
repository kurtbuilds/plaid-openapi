    /**Create an Asset Report

The `/asset_report/create` endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoints.

The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).

The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.

    /**Retrieve an Asset Report

The `/asset_report/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling `/asset_report/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.

To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call the `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

    /**Retrieve a PDF Asset Report

The `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling `/asset_report/pdf/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

The response to `/asset_report/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id`  is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

    /**Refresh an Asset Report

An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user's assets. In order to "refresh" an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.

The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to `/asset_report/filter`. By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original `/asset_report/create` request, but the original `days_requested` value and the values of any parameters in the `options` object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to `/asset_report/refresh`. Submit an empty string ("") for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

See endpoint docs at <https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportrefresh>.*/

            days_requested: None,
            options: None,
        }
    }
    /**Filter Asset Report

By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.

Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

The `/asset_report/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Asset Report. Removing an Asset Report invalidates its `asset_report_token`, meaning you will no longer be able to use it to access Report data or create new Audit Copies. Removing an Asset Report does not affect the underlying Items, but does invalidate any `audit_copy_tokens` associated with the Asset Report.

    /**Create Asset Report Audit Copy

Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.

To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

    /**Get transaction data

The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

    /**Refresh transaction data

`/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item from that institution.

`/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

    /**Fetch recurring transaction streams

The `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.

This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.

After the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

    /**Get incremental transaction updates on an Item

This endpoint replaces `/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.

The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.

This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.

Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.

In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.

Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.

When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.

Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

Note that for newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.

To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

Note that in the Development environment, issuing an `/item/remove`  request will not decrement your live credential count. To increase your credential account in Development, contact Support.

Also note that for certain OAuth-based institutions, an Item removed via `/item/remove` may still show as an active connection in the institution's OAuth permission manager.

The `/accounts/get` endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of accounts associated with any linked Item. Plaid will only return active bank accounts — that is, accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.
For items that went through the updated account selection pane, this endpoint only returns accounts that were permissioned by the user when they initially created the Item. If a user creates a new account after the initial link, you can capture this event through the [`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.

This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/accounts/balance/get` instead. Note that some information is nullable.

The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link. As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints; if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

This request may take some time to complete if identity was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.

Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency). For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been deprecated. New Plaid customers will be unable to use this endpoint, and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the newer, `link_token`-based flow. The recommended flow is to provide the `payment_id` to `/link/token/create`, which returns a `link_token` used to initialize Link.

The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` is used to create a `payment_token`, which can then be used in Link initialization to enter a payment initiation flow. You can only use a `payment_token` once. If this attempt fails, the end user aborts the flow, or the token expires, you will need to create a new payment token. Creating a new payment token does not require end user input.

  - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).

  - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).

  - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

  - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance` endpoint to advance a `test_clock` in the Sandbox environment.

A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. A test clock can be advanced by incrementing `virtual_time`, but may never go back to a lower `virtual_time`.

If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed.
For instance, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events.

The advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with the `test_clock`.
For instance, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to 80 weeks on each API call.

`/credit/payroll_income/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification. If the user is eligible for digital verification, that information will be associated with the user token, and in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

While all request fields are optional, providing `employer` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

When testing in Sandbox, you can control the results by providing special test values in the `employer` and `access_tokens` fields. `employer_good` and `employer_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively. `employer_multi` will result in a `HIGH` confidence with multiple payroll options. Likewise, `access_good` and `access_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively.
